# Enhancing Code Quality with AI Code Reviews

**3-line summary**
- AI catches trivial issues (null checks, wrong endpoints) early.
- Human reviewers focus on architecture and security.
- PR cycle time drops; developer satisfaction improves.

**1-line insight**  
Automate the *obvious* so humans can debate the *important*.

## Notes
- Good guardrails and high-precision prompts matter.
- Start with non-blocking comments; build trust, then gate.
